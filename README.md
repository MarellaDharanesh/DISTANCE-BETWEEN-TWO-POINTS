# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
Step 1:
Import math function.

Step 2:
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated

Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula

formula

Step 4:
Print the coding to get the answer.

Step 5:
End the program.

import math
x1,y1,x2,y2=10,6,4,2
dist=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
```
